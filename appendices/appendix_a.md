# Appendix A: Key Concepts Defined

## Cosmic Womb
Life as a temporary phase of growth, akin to gestation, preparing us for spiritual birth into an eternal realm. Just as a fetus develops in preparation for physical birth, we develop spiritually in preparation for our transition to eternal existence.

## Moral Spiral
A progression of choices leading either "up" toward divine love and harmony or "down" toward isolation and self-centeredness. This spiral represents our spiritual trajectory through life, shaped by our decisions and their cumulative effects.

## Conscience
A value-neutral mechanism for spiritual development, combining intellectual and emotional learning to shape our personality through chosen actions. Not inherently tied to absolute moral values, but serving as a tool for growth and development.

## Perfect Love
Love that reflects God's nature—selfless, eternal, and purposeful—expressed uniquely by each individual. While the structure of love is universal, its expression varies according to personality and circumstance.

## Pre-fall Culture
The original culture our creator meant for us to build and experience, aspects of which we still encounter but rarely recognize. Understanding this helps us align with our intended purpose and development.

## Three-Parent Model
The understanding that each human has three parents:
- Biological mother (physical vessel)
- Biological father (physical vessel)
- God (spiritual progenitor)
This model explains both our physical inheritance and divine essence.

## Spiritual Deposit
The moment when God endowed two prepared vessels (around 200,000 years ago) with eternal spirits, marking the true beginning of humanity. This explains both our physical evolution and spiritual uniqueness.

## Stepped Life Stages
The four major phases of spiritual development:
1. Adult Individual
2. Parent
3. Grandparent
4. Great-grandparent
Each stage represents increasing spiritual sensitivity and responsibility.

## Divine Programs
Internal and external mechanisms provided by God to guide our growth:
- Internal: conscience, intuition, capacity for love
- External: religion, community, educational systems

## Persistent Immaturity
A state where individuals refuse to progress through normal spiritual development, remaining fixated on physical pleasures or negative emotions rather than growing toward spiritual maturity.

## Familial Love Types
The four fundamental expressions of love:
1. Parental Love (nurturing, sacrificial)
2. Filial Love (respect, gratitude)
3. Conjugal Love (unity, partnership)
4. Sibling Love (equality, companionship)

## Spiritual Sensitivity
The growing awareness of and connection to the eternal realm, typically increasing as one progresses through life stages, particularly approaching great-grandparenthood.

# Chapter 2: The Cosmic Womb

Life can be understood as a temporary phase of growth, akin to gestation in a womb. Just as a developing baby needs nutrients in the womb, we require resources in this temporary worldâ€”not as an end goal, but as means to fulfill our responsibilities, nurture relationships, and contribute meaningfully.

> "A human being in this world is similar to a fetus in a woman's womb. It is growing through a relationship with the physical world mediated through the mother, but as the child gets nearer to birth, it begins to relate more directly with that physical world. It will respond to loud sounds, spicy food etc. The child in the womb can not possibly understand driving a car, however. It is reasonable to expect that at some point in the child's life it will drive a car, but as a baby in the womb, it has not yet gone through the 'phase change' that will allow it to grow into its adult, self-aware state that will drive the car."

God's omnipresence provides a constant parental presence, guiding us through challenges as we prepare for a spiritual "birth" into an eternal realm. This preparation involves dynamic tension, as growth requires opposing forces that mirror both physical and spiritual development.

> "It would also be a logical inference to think that, just as the mother is constantly present with the fetus/child throughout its gestation, God also is omnipresent with each of us as we make our way through the course of our life in our 'cosmic womb'."

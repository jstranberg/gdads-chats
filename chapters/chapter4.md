# Chapter 4: The Conscience as a Tool

The conscience serves as a value-neutral mechanism for spiritual development. Its structure combines intellectual learning and emotional learning, which lead to chosen actions. These actions cement learning into personality, defining who we become.

> "Today I would like to explore what tools our creator would have given us in that 'pre-fall' world in order for us to be able to perceive that we were growing in a positive direction. I would argue that we still experience that 'tool' God gave us and that we have common names for things like that. In this case, we call this tool (in modern English) a 'Conscience', and each of us has one and each of us experiences how it works."

However, the conscience is not inherently tied to absolute moral values, as we might assume:

> "I would have to correct you on the assumption you made; namely that our conscience 'operates on absolute moral values.' This is incorrect in two ways: 1) because we live in a relativistic moral world, we have never seen yet a system of absolute moral standards, and 2) because the tool God would have given us would have recognized that our life in the 'cosmic womb' would, by nature be temporary and designed to help us learn how to become an absolute morally valuable being. For these two reasons, I would argue that the structure of the conscience is mechanically value neutral."

## The Mechanics of Conscience

The mechanics of conscience can be understood as:

> "It is a created tool to input two forms of learning: 1) intellectual knowledge and 2) emotional knowledge. Based on what we learn at any given stage of life, we then decide how to ACT. It is this final stage of action that cements our intellectual and emotional learning into a concretized form of character we call 'Personality'. In short, as we learn intellectually and emotionally, we create ourselves through how we actionize that learning."

This understanding can be observed in various contexts, even distorted ones:

> "We can see this understanding in action by the universal experiences of gang membership. The gang carefully educates its young supplicants and then requires a violent ACT (called initiation) in order to become a full member of the gang. This is simply the bastardized, yet disturbingly complete, understanding of the mechanics of the conscience."

## The Role of Choice

The conscience serves as a guide, but our choices determine its effectiveness. Through our decisions to act on intellectual and emotional learning, we shape not just our behavior but our very character. This aligns with the concept of the cosmic womb, where our temporary existence provides opportunities for growth and development through conscious choice.

## Growth Through Conscience

The conscience functions as a developmental tool, helping us:
- Process intellectual understanding
- Integrate emotional experiences
- Make conscious choices
- Form lasting character traits
- Progress toward spiritual maturity

This mechanism allows us to navigate our growth within the cosmic womb, preparing us for our eventual spiritual birth into eternity.

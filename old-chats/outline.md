## Part I: Foundations of Existence

### Chapter 1: Children of a Purposeful Creator

The timeless inquiry "What is the purpose of life?" has kept philosophers, poets, and everyday folks pondering for ages. While there's no definitive answer, we can explore some thoughts based on our understanding of humanity's nature.

#### Our Dual Nature

Humanity exists with a dual nature: we are eternal beings in a symbiotic relationship with our physical bodies. Rather than being immutably part of our bodies, we are beings inhabiting them. Our origin begins beyond the material expression of the universe, and we return to that state after our bodies cease to function.

> "I would suggest it would be much more useful, as well as fitting the facts better, to structure our conversations with the understanding that human beings exist in a symbiotic relationship with their bodies, but that the fundamental nature of humanity is that we are a being inhabiting our body, rather than immutably part of it. Having an origin that begins beyond the material expression of the universe (and returning to that state after the ceasing of the body's functions), would, I think, be a much more powerful paradigm in understanding the immense power and potential of humanity—both individually and collectively."

#### Divine Love as the Universal Standard

God, as the source of true love, sets the universal standard for what love truly is. Each person is a unique co-creator, shaping their personality through choices made within this physical realm. While love's structure is universal, its expression is individual—like in a family where the parents' love is constant, but each child reflects it in their own way.

#### The Three-Parent Model

Every human has three parents:
1. The biological mother
2. The biological father
3. God as the spiritual progenitor

While the mother and father provide the physical vessel, God supplies the spiritual spark that defines true humanity. This understanding helps explain both our physical inheritance and our divine potential.

#### Our Role as Co-Creators

This perspective highlights the significant potential we have, not just as individuals, but as a collective humanity. As children of a purposeful Creator, we are:
- Eternal beings temporarily inhabiting physical bodies
- Unique expressions of divine love
- Co-creators of our own personality through our choices
- Part of a larger family of humanity
- Destined for an existence beyond our current physical limitations

Our ultimate purpose might be about aligning our spiritual and physical selves to fulfill a greater role in the universe.

### Chapter 2: The Cosmic Womb

Life can be understood as a temporary phase of growth, akin to gestation in a womb. Just as a developing baby needs nutrients in the womb, we require resources in this temporary world—not as an end goal, but as means to fulfill our responsibilities, nurture relationships, and contribute meaningfully.

> "A human being in this world is similar to a fetus in a woman's womb. It is growing through a relationship with the physical world mediated through the mother, but as the child gets nearer to birth, it begins to relate more directly with that physical world. It will respond to loud sounds, spicy food etc. The child in the womb can not possibly understand driving a car, however. It is reasonable to expect that at some point in the child's life it will drive a car, but as a baby in the womb, it has not yet gone through the 'phase change' that will allow it to grow into its adult, self-aware state that will drive the car."

God's omnipresence provides a constant parental presence, guiding us through challenges as we prepare for a spiritual "birth" into an eternal realm. This preparation involves dynamic tension, as growth requires opposing forces that mirror both physical and spiritual development.

> "It would also be a logical inference to think that, just as the mother is constantly present with the fetus/child throughout its gestation, God also is omnipresent with each of us as we make our way through the course of our life in our 'cosmic womb'."

Living our life is like going through an educational course, where we face challenges and gain new insights that help us understand our purpose better. Each "class" might be different—relationships, responsibilities, or personal trials—but they all contribute to our overall growth. Our actions and decisions serve as assessments that help us gauge our progress.

In this cosmic womb, money and resources are like the nutrients that a developing baby needs—essential for growth and survival but not the ultimate purpose of our existence.

> "The obvious conclusion is that that same human, as he/she is growing through this 'cosmic womb' will become more sensitive to the spirit world as he/she live the whole of their life in this physical world. It would be logical to expect that that same person, and all persons become somewhat more sensitive to the approaching spirit world. This in no way means that such sensitivity would be a universally 'positive' experience. That would depend on how that person created their personality through the choices made in their physical life."

### Chapter 3: Adam and Eve as Progenitors

If human beings are eternal in nature and are just inhabiting physical bodies in the physical universe for the purpose of growth, at some point, that part of our nature that is beyond time and space must have been "deposited" into two unique physical bodies (male and female).

Scientific evidence suggests Homo sapiens emerged around 300,000 years ago in Africa, with genetic and behavioral modernity solidifying roughly 70,000–50,000 years ago. However, if "human" is primarily an unbounded spiritual essence deposited into male and female bodies, then fossil evidence only tells part of the story.

Studies suggest a single maternal origin: Mitochondrial Eve, the most recent matrilineal ancestor of all living humans, estimated to have lived around 155,000–200,000 years ago in Africa. Similarly, Y-chromosomal Adam, the patrilineal counterpart, is dated to roughly 200,000–300,000 years ago.

> "If we accept that humanity is a 'child of God', and that at some point, God must have endowed two appropriately receptive beings with eternal life, would it not be logical to state that 200,000 years ago God took his biologically prepared vessels, prepared to host an eternal spirit? This would explain quite a lot about the confusing discussions about what 'humanity is', would it not?"

If we accept humanity as eternal beings—children of an unbounded God—temporarily housed in physical bodies for growth, it's logical that God selected two receptive individuals, male and female, at a point when their biological forms could host this spiritual essence, marking the true dawn of "humanity." This would have occurred around 200,000 years ago, when science notes genetic bottlenecks and behavioral shifts.

This view elegantly explains the genetic evidence of competing lines like Neanderthals. If humanity's true essence is the eternal spirit, not just the physical form, then our bodies could indeed carry traces of interbreeding with Neanderthals or Denisovans, reflecting a broader biological tapestry that predates or coexists with the spiritual deposit.

> "This view, where God endowed two biologically prepared vessels with eternal spirits around 200,000 years ago, elegantly explains the genetic evidence of competing lines like Neanderthals while mirroring our own bioengineering tendencies. If humanity's true essence is the eternal spirit, not just the physical form, then our bodies could indeed carry traces of interbreeding with Neanderthals or Denisovans (evidenced by 1–4% archaic DNA in non-African genomes), reflecting a broader biological tapestry that predates or coexists with the spiritual deposit."

The extinction of these competing lines suggests they lacked the eternal essence that sustained humanity's unique trajectory. Like discarded prototypes, these lines served a purpose in refining the physical vessel, but once God's chosen specimens received the spiritual deposit, the others became obsolete.

> "If our eternal nature defines us, and those archaic hominids were biological 'possibles' not chosen for that divine spark, their role as evolutionary stepping stones or experimental scaffolds ended once the prepared pair—aligned with Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam—emerged."

This theory also explains how every human has three parents: the biological mother, father, and God as the spiritual progenitor. While the mother and father provide the physical vessel, God supplies the spiritual spark that defines true humanity.

> "Your theory—that God endowed two vessels with eternal spirits ~200,000 years ago, making humans uniquely eternal—indeed opens a fascinating way to see every human as having three parents: the biological mother, father, and God as the spiritual progenitor. If our eternal nature is deposited into physical bodies, as with your Adam-and-Eve-like pair, then God acts as the third parent, infusing that timeless essence into the genetic offspring of the chosen two, whose lines trace back to Mitochondrial Eve and Y-chromosomal Adam."

It also explains why we see intelligence, emotion, and will across creation, peaking in creatures closest to our physical form. Other beings—like dogs—might reflect a lesser echo of that spiritual essence, a gradient of God's creative imprint without the eternal soul.

> "Your theory—that God endowed two vessels with eternal spirits ~200,000 years ago, making humans uniquely eternal—beautifully explains why we see intelligence, emotion, and will across creation, peaking in creatures closest to our physical form, yet distinct in eternity. If humanity's eternal nature stems from a divine deposit, other beings—like dogs, with their remarkable love, loyalty, and apparent will—might reflect a lesser echo of that spiritual essence, a gradient of God's creative imprint without the eternal soul."

## Part II: The Mechanics of Growth

### Chapter 4: The Conscience as a Tool

The conscience serves as a value-neutral mechanism for spiritual development. Its structure combines intellectual learning and emotional learning, which lead to chosen actions. These actions cement learning into personality, defining who we become.

> "Today I would like to explore what tools our creator would have given us in that 'pre-fall' world in order for us to be able to perceive that we were growing in a positive direction. I would argue that we still experience that 'tool' God gave us and that we have common names for things like that. In this case, we call this tool (in modern English) a 'Conscience', and each of us has one and each of us experiences how it works."

However, the conscience is not inherently tied to absolute moral values, as we might assume:

> "I would have to correct you on the assumption you made; namely that our conscience 'operates on absolute moral values.' This is incorrect in two ways: 1) because we live in a relativistic moral world, we have never seen yet a system of absolute moral standards, and 2) because the tool God would have given us would have recognized that our life in the 'cosmic womb' would, by nature be temporary and designed to help us learn how to become an absolute morally valuable being. For these two reasons, I would argue that the structure of the conscience is mechanically value neutral."

The mechanics of conscience can be understood as:

> "It is a created tool to input two forms of learning: 1) intellectual knowledge and 2) emotional knowledge. Based on what we learn at any given stage of life, we then decide how to ACT. It is this final stage of action that cements our intellectual and emotional learning into a concretized form of character we call 'Personality'. In short, as we learn intellectually and emotionally, we create ourselves through how we actionize that learning."

This understanding can be observed in various contexts, even distorted ones:

> "We can see this understanding in action by the universal experiences of gang membership. The gang carefully educates its young supplicants and then requires a violent ACT (called initiation) in order to become a full member of the gang. This is simply the bastardized, yet disturbingly complete, understanding of the mechanics of the conscience."

### Chapter 5: The Moral Spiral

The moral spiral represents a progression of choices leading either "up" or "down" a moral path. The upward spiral involves moving beyond selfishness toward divine love and harmony, resulting in alignment with God's nature and fulfilling Matthew 5:48: "Be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect."

Conversely, the downward spiral leads to isolation, self-centeredness, and a focus on physical desires, resulting in becoming "moral animals" detached from eternal purpose. Every choice shapes our trajectory, preparing us for eternity.

## Part III: The Shape of Perfect Love

### Chapter 6: Love's Universal Parameters

God's love serves as the benchmark: selfless, eternal, and purposeful. There are four fundamental expressions of love:

1. Parental love: nurturing and sacrificial
2. Filial love: respect and gratitude
3. Conjugal love: unity and partnership
4. Sibling love: equality and companionship

The family functions as a microcosm for perfecting these loves across generations.

### Chapter 7: The Familial Moral Spiral

Life stages provide opportunities for growth:

1. Childhood: receiving love, learning foundations
2. Parenthood: giving love, refining responsibility
3. Grandparenthood: reflecting and broadening love's scope
4. Great-grandparenthood: embodying a legacy of love

Each phase informs the next, enhancing moral development. The goal is a life of perfect love, lived correctly within the cosmic womb.

> "The three stages of life can be understood as periods of growth and development within a relational and purposeful framework. The first stage is childhood, where the focus is on growth and learning within the family unit. Children are nurtured by their parents and learn the basics of love, responsibility, and respect within the safe boundaries of their family. The second stage is adulthood, where individuals establish their own families and take on roles that contribute to society. This stage emphasizes fulfilling one's responsibilities in relationships and society, understanding one's purpose, and participating in the harmonious order of the community. The final stage is old age, where wisdom and experience are shared with younger generations. Elders provide guidance and maintain the continuity of values and traditions..."

## Part IV: Challenges and Triumphs

### Chapter 8: Forgiveness as the Pivot

Forgiveness serves as the key to spiraling upward. It's a dual process: seeking forgiveness from God and extending it to others. This transforms suffering into "gold" for personal and communal growth. Forgiveness reflects God's love, regardless of whether others accept it.

> "Forgiveness definitely mirrors the dual nature of salvation. First, we seek forgiveness from God, which helps us realign with our divine purpose and restore that fundamental relationship. Then, we extend forgiveness to others, which strengthens and heals our human relationships. It's about creating a harmonious flow where forgiveness received from God naturally leads to forgiveness offered to others. By doing this, we're not only mending individual relationships but also contributing to a more unified and loving community. So, forgiving and being forgiven becomes a shared journey, weaving us closer together both spiritually and socially."

### Chapter 9: The Tension of Free Will

God respects our autonomy, choosing not to interfere in the "fall" to preserve our divine potential. We shape ourselves through responses to truth and challenges. This dynamic tension—opposition through trials and relationships—drives spiritual strength. As divine beings, we have the unique capacity to co-create our eternal nature.

### Chapter 10: Spiritual Growth and Divine Guidance

Our spiritual nature is naturally unbounded by the physical world. Human beings are, by nature, eternal beings encased in a physical reality, temporarily bound here so that we can gain mastery of ourselves and our spiritual nature, step by step. This is similar to a parent setting up a playpen for a toddler, giving strong instructions to "not cross that street" to a child, and not letting a teenager drive until they show mastery of certain skills.

The stepped nature of human life involves:
1) Learning to manifest as a responsible adult individual
2) Becoming a parent
3) Becoming a grandparent
4) Becoming a great-grandparent

These four stages represent an internal life course where we learn the nature of love and responsibility. Young people are generally very centered on their physical bodies, emotions, and life experiences, while great-grandparents are much closer to, and more sensitive to, the spirit world due to their proximity to crossing over.

Since God is unbounded by space and time, any separation between us in the physical world and God might be more apparent than real. The mechanism that creates what we feel as "separation" likely stems from the interplay of our physical embodiment and limited perception, acting as a veil within the playpen of space-time.

Many older people don't perceive God, suggesting an additional layer of separation beyond the physical veil, perhaps tied to this world's "broken souls." This extra element could be a fracture in our eternal essence—a moral or existential disconnect from love and responsibility.

All human beings in the physical world are immature in a spiritual sense. A person refusing to grow into their mature stage can be described as "persistently and possibly determinedly immature," clinging to the playpen's toys—material pleasures or petty hatreds—instead of advancing through the steps of love and responsibility.

Despite God's omnipresence and omnipotence, He doesn't "snap His fingers" and fix all problems because the physical world is designed for our gradual mastery of love and responsibility as eternal beings. God provides "programs" to guide us toward successful mastery, including internal processes (conscience, intuition) and external manifestations (religion, churches, psychology). However, the mere existence of these external organizations doesn't guarantee a positive effect on a person's soul; their impact depends on how they're engaged.

## Conclusion: Striving for the Divine Ideal

Life's purpose is to mature into perfect love, guided by conscience and expressed uniquely within God's framework. The moral spiral represents a lifelong and generational journey. We are called to embrace challenges, forgive, and love—preparing for birth into eternity.

Jesus' admonition in Matthew 5:48 to "be perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect" is an attainable goal within the cosmic womb, aligning us with our Creator's heart.

> "So as we come inevitably closer to a world of no 'work', to find and create meaningful lives, it will be necessary to reformulate how we create a valuable life. Right now, people (especially men) find value in what they DO and how many people look on what they do with respect. This will probably stay the same, but rather than looking at it simply (such as 'I am a driver') it will be necessary to reappraise what we do as to how we serve other humans. E.G. salvation is relational with other humans."

As we face changing paradigms in society, we must remember that our value comes not from what we do professionally, but from how we serve and connect with others. This relational understanding of salvation and purpose will become increasingly important.

> "So humanity looks at these questions as novel problems to be solved due to the emerging pressures of the day, but I would like to suggest that we look to a concept I call a 'Pre-fall culture'. This means trying to discern what was the original culture our creator meant for us to build and experience. Though we experience many aspects of such a pre-fall culture in our daily lives, we rarely recognize them as such. That would be a very fruitful area of study perhaps."

By exploring what a "pre-fall culture" might have looked like—the original design for human relationships and society—we can better understand our purpose and how to fulfill it in today's world.
